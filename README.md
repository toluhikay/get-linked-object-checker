# Object Detection with Next.js

This project is an object detection application built with Next.js. It leverages the `@tensorflow/tfjs` library for object detection, an internet speed checker for network speed, and a screen brightness checker to determine the device's screen brightness. API routes are utilized to handle various operations.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of an object detection system using Next.js and TensorFlow.js. Additionally, it includes features to check internet speed and screen brightness of the user's device.

## Features

- Object Detection using `@tensorflow/tfjs`
- Network speed checker
- Screen brightness checker
- API routes to handle processing

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-detection-nextjs.git
   cd object-detection-nextjs
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

### Object Detection

The object detection feature uses TensorFlow.js to identify objects within images or video streams.

### Internet Speed Checker

The internet speed checker determines the user's network speed by downloading a sample image and measuring the download time.

### Screen Brightness Checker

This feature measures the screen brightness of the user's device.
